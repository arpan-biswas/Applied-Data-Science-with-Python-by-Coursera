# Write an initialization line as a single list comprehension which creates a list of all possible user ids. Assume the letters are all lower case.

lowercase = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
digits = '0123456789'

correct_answer = [a+b+c+d for a in lowercase for b in lowercase for c in digits for d in digits]

correct_answer[:50] # Display first 50 ids
